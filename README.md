# GoOutside

This application pops up a message an hour after your screen was last unlocked - a reminder that there's better things to be staring at.

It also has an amusingly tomato-shaped [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) timer.

(An attempt to learn about WPF, C# events, AutoFac and testing it all way too thoroughly).
